Qt\+Web\+App is a H\+T\+TP server library in C++, based on Qt Framework. Fork from Stefan Qt\+Web\+App\+: \href{http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/index-en.html}{\tt http\+://stefanfrings.\+de/qtwebapp/index-\/en.\+html}

The main idea of this fork is to add Websockets support. ~\newline
Qt framework doesn\textquotesingle{}t support direct upgrade from Q\+Tcp\+Socket to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_web_socket}{Q\+Web\+Socket}} sockets in the current moment. Therefore, I decided to copy Qt\+Websocket library in Qt\+Web\+App and to made necessary changes in library in order to support websocket upgrade. Example Demo1 has been updated to demonstrate Web\+Socket communication. By default server is started in https secured mode on \href{https://localhost:8080}{\tt https\+://localhost\+:8080}. In order to work correctly D\+E\+M\+O1 you need to copy directory /etc (located in Demo1 folder) in location where Demo1 executable will be located after the build.

You can go in browser on \href{https://localhost:8080}{\tt https\+://localhost\+:8080} and there is located a link to simple Websockets demo.

P.\+S. Your browser can give you a point where your conection isn\textquotesingle{}t secured (becouse used certificate aren\textquotesingle{}t signed by CA) and you need to skip this and continue.
